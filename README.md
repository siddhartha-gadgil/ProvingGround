Proving Ground: Towards Computers as Mathematical Collaborators
===============================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/siddhartha-gadgil/ProvingGround.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/siddhartha-gadgil/ProvingGround)

A collection of tools built towards the ultimate goal of computers becoming *collaborators* rather than *assistants* for doing Mathematics. At present this contains, in early stages of development, code for translating (some) mathematical prose into (quasi-)logical structures.
